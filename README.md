## FlappyFish

### Background

This game will be an infinite runner type game based on Flappy bird, a side-scroller game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without hitting them. FlappyBird was the most downloaded game in the iOS App Store.

FlappyFish is a one to two player game, that will utilize a 'game window' (most likely HTML 4 canvas element) for most of the game functionality, where the player will control a "fish". the rules of the games are as follows:

1. The user earns points over time.
2. The user has one life. Lives are lost by bumping into obstacles.
3. Obstacles are positioned in the ocean, and users must swim between these obstacles to avoid them.
4. Players are able to obtain power-ups

5. Scaling difficulty(bonus)
6. Two player functionality(bonus)
